Assignment #34 - A Picture is Worth 1,000 Words

Get to know React Router by building yourself a small photo gallery site.

Objectives:

    Adding dependencies to your React Project
    Navigating JSON data structures
    Using the React Router library
    Using parameters in React Router

Requirements:

Using the JSON data below as a starter, build a photo gallery app.

Explorer Mode

    You should have at least 4 components: App, CategoryList, PhotoList, PhotoDetail.
    On the home page, your category list should render the title of each category and link using the key. For examples "Panda Bears" should link to /pandas
    Render each photo in the given category on the photo list page with a thumbnail sized version of your photos.
    Render a large version of the photo on the photo details page.

Adventure Mode

    Customize the given data to include your own photos and categories.
    Add bread crumb navigation, as seen in the example.
    Add a thumbnail to the first photo in each category to the home page, as seen in the example.

Epic Mode

    Find an external API for a photo sharing site (such as Flickr) and use data from the API rather than the given JSON file.
